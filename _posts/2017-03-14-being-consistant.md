I have observed that new projects do not offer much to learn than old aged projects. Older projects, having footprints of many developers also carry
mistakes by those developers. 

In such a situation, I don't really need to make many mistakes to learn. I already have mistakes by other developers, I just
need to observe and be careful about these mistakes next time.

Working on an antique (not really antique, it is just 6 months old) project, I have found that

> Poor concentration on naming conventions make it ugly, really hard to read, or even understand the code.

I am going through this phase and I can tell you it's really cumbersome. It pisses me off whenever I look at it.

Put it all aside, let's discuss *how we should name things as programmer/software developers*. Back in the days, I was very careful about naming conventions and believe me I am still very concious about it. I used spend hours while searching the
best convention for a given context.

After searching a bit, I used to go with some convention but eventually, I have found that

> *No matter what convention you choose or no matter what convention you think is the best, if you have chosen one; **stick to it for the rest of the
> project**. This is the only most important thing in the world of conventions. Don't mix many conventions. Chose one and use it throughout the project.*{:.yellow}

While writing this closing para, I got this beautiful verse in my mind

دو رنگی چھوڑ ، یک رنگ ہو جا

{% highlight text %}
Do rangi chor, yak  rang ho ja

Sara moum, ya phir sang ho ja ...
{% endhighlight %}

Although it is not written in programming context, it fits nicely here. See you next time.
