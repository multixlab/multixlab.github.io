I work on a similar kind of code nowadays and every time I come across a situation where I need to look for `onClick` listeners, I promise myself
to write an article about it and fortunately today, I have some spare time to write about it.

While setting `onClick` listeners in `XML layouts` is not inherently bad, it's not good either. Whenever I talk to my friends or other developers
I work with, I tell them to be **consistent** and follow the same approach for whole project. If at the start of project you have decided to
go on with setting `onClicks` in `XML layouts`; then for every single view that you need, write click listener in `XML` - for every single
 view which needs it - for every single ...

Writing `onClick` listeners in `XML` is relatively easy, you don't need to fetch the view by ID and android studio will implement the
method for you. This approach is not bad if you are writing a test project or demo where you quickly want to add click listeners and there are
few views which need to be clickable. Say, I have an activity which has *two* buttons - start and end. I write `onClicks` in `XML` and it's easy
for me to find out where those two methods are in the class because there are just two.
